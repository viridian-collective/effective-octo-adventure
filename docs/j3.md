countable hierarchy of non-cumulative universes and inductive types.

In type theory, a universe is a type that contains other types as its elements. A non-cumulative hierarchy of universes means that each universe is distinct and does not include the types from lower universes. This is in contrast to cumulative hierarchies, where each universe includes all types from the previous ones.

For example, we might have a hierarchy of universes like this:
- `U0`: The lowest universe, containing basic types like `Nat` (natural numbers) and `Bool` (booleans)- `U1`: A higher universe that contains `U0` and additional types like `List` (lists of elements from `U0`)
- `U2`: An even higher universe that contains `U1` and more complex types like `Tree` (trees of elements from `U1`)    
In a non-cumulative hierarchy, `U1` does not contain `Nat` or `Bool` directly; it only contains types that are explicitly defined in `U1` or higher. This means that if you have a type in `U0`, you cannot use it directly in `U1` without some form of lifting or embedding.  
Inductive types are types that are defined by specifying their constructors. They are often used to define data structures like lists, trees, and natural numbers. In a non-cumulative hierarchy of universes, inductive types can be defined at different levels of the hierarchy, but they must respect the constraints of the universe they are defined in. For example, you might define an inductive type `MyList` in `U1` that can only contain elements from `U0`, but you cannot define a `MyList` in `U0` that contains elements from `U1`.    
This non-cumulative approach can help avoid certain paradoxes and inconsistencies that can arise in type theory, such as Girard's paradox. It also allows for more precise control over the types and their relationships, which can be beneficial in formalizing mathematics and computer science concepts.
Overall, a non-cumulative hierarchy of universes and inductive types provides a structured way to organize types in type theory, ensuring clarity and consistency in their definitions and usage.
A non-cumulative hierarchy of universes is a structure in type theory where each universe is distinct and does not include the types from lower universes. This is in contrast to cumulative hierarchies, where each universe includes all types from the previous ones.
